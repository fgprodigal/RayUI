Notes To Myself
---------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Diff since last release:

    TAGDIR=svn://svn.curseforge.net/wow/litemount/mainline/tags
    LATEST=`svn ls -v $TAGDIR | grep -v 'beta' | tail -1 | awk '{print $NF}'`
    svn diff svn://svn.curseforge.net/wow/litemount/mainline/tags/$LATEST \
             svn://svn.curseforge.net/wow/litemount/mainline/trunk


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* XML syntax check

    xmllint --noout UIOptionsFrame.xml


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* To Do List

    Try to get more translations done.

    Mount weighting system.
      - How does it work with the enable/disable all button.

    Revisit and adjust/rewrite all the documentation.

    Revisit the Unavailable macro suggestion buttons.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Running Wild under ShapeShift

    You can't use Running Wild when you are shapeshifted (e.g., you are
    transformed into a Night Elf or Human by a dungeon buff).  Unfortunately
    IsUsableSpell() still returns true in that case.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Passenger-capable mounts

    Possibility of preferring a passenger-capable mount if you are in
    a group.  I think they would need to be flagged by hand though, which
    is probably too much of a maintenance nightmare.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Better "undo".

    Conclusion: seems unncessary.

    Might be able to set up the macro better for undoing in combat what we
    last did (mount -> dismount, form -> cancelform, aura -> cancelaura, etc.)
    by passing params between the PreClick handler and the PostClick handler
    as button attributes.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Suggestions

    The suggestions stuff in the "last resort" macro is a bit clunky and
    is probably going to be a pain to maintain.  Consider ripping it out
    completely.

    Also since we are now testing IsSpellKnown we don't need to separate
    out the spells by class they way they are set up now.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Flying mounts that can walk.

    Since IsUsableSpell() correctly tells you whether you can use a flying
    mount in a non-flying area, we don't actually need to unflag the ground
    setting on flying mounts.  They'll get tested and excluded anyway.

    Then again, I don't really like using flying mounts on the ground, since
    there's already plenty of chance to see them and not much chance to see
    your ground-only mounts.  And it makes the flags in the UI look weird.
    The whole UI flag stuff was born out of trying to fix this stupidity.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Possible UI Improvements

    Have an enable/disable all button. Have it apply only to the current match.
    Localize the Fly/Run/Swim texts.

    Enable/disable all makes it too easy to accidentally screw up your
    selections.  It needs to be done in conjunction with only applying
    the changes on clicking "Okay".


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Drag button for mounts.

    Implemented.  Blizzard are going to add seach on the mount pane anyway.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* "Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest" (71086)

    Item ID 71086.  Spell ID is 101641 (Tarecgosa's Visage)

    You can only use it by "/use slot", you can't cast the spell.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Might be better to look for Sea Legs aura for Vashj'ir.

    Sea legs is present even on the surface and flying so don't do it.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* You can use flying mounts when you are floating in flyable areas.

    IsUsableSpell() returns correctly for mount spells for swimming
    vs floating.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Flying in areas you don't know how to.

    Testing shows IsFlyableArea() works properly for you.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Does GetUnitSpeed return negative if you go backwards?

    No it doesn't.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* You can know tradeskill-only mounts for tradeskills you unlearned.

    I was sure this used to work properly with IsUsableSpell() but it
    definitely doesn't as of 5.0.4.  I've had to hard-code a list of
    profession-specific mounts and the skillLines (clunky) that
    indicate the profession for each.

    There is probably still an issue with having enough skill in the
    profession to know them.

    By the look of the MoP data in wowhead there are no new mounts that
    require professions to use (they are all BoE, anyone can use).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Check when/if IsSpellKnown() is a better idea.

    So far it seems identical to looping over the spellbook tab. It
    never returns true for mount spells.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Code documentation.

    Utility stuff:
        * Print.lua
            LM_Print(msg) -- prints into current active chat frame
            LM_SetDebug(onoff) -- turn debugging on/off

        * AutoEventFrame.lua
            LM_CreateAutoEventFrame(frameType, ...)
                * takes the same args as CreateFrame
                * Adds an OnEvent handler that calls a function named
                  for the event. E.g., MyFrame:PLAYER_LOGIN().

            Here be dragons. UI to twiddle settings in LM_Options.

    Main stuff:
        * Mount.lua
            Class representing one mount.

            m = LM_Mount:GetMountByItemId(itemId, itemSpellId)
            m = LM_Mount:GetMountBySpell(spellId)

            m:CanFly() / m:CanWalk() / m:CanSwim()
            m:Usable()
            m:Flags() / m:DefaultFlags()
                Flags call does LM_Options:ApplySpellFlags for you.

                Sets attributes on a SecureActionButton to summon this mount.
        * MountList.lua

            LM_MountList:Shuffle()
            LM_MountList:Random()

            LM_Options:IsExcludedSpell() is true.
        * Core.lua
            All the core logic for initialization and then actually
            picking a mount and summoning it.
